Initially, I started building the website manually, focusing on traditional methods like writing raw HTML, CSS, and setting up layouts by hand.
While it gave me a strong understanding of how things work behind the scenes, I realized that in real-world projects, delivering results efficiently and maintaining quality is what matters most.

Additionally, I recognized how I was, in one way or another, falling behind in keeping up with current trends. 

Instead of relying on traditional methods that would leave me outdated with the advancing technology, I used the time constraints to deliver the best outcomes.

The reason it took me two days to complete this simple project was that I was typing manually. I then realized that instead of working hard, I should work smart.

To optimize the process, I decided to integrate AI tools into my workflow.
AI helped me quickly generate the basic framework and visual structure of the website, allowing me to shift more attention toward customization, user experience, and fine-tuning the design.

By combining manual skills with AI support, I was able to complete the project faster without compromising quality.
This experience taught me the importance of being adaptable and outcome-focused â€” skills that are essential in any professional environment.
